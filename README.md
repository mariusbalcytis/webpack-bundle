Bundle to Integrate Webpack into Symfony
====

Symfony bundle to help integrating [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) into Symfony project.

What is webpack?
----

Module bundler and CommonJS / AMD dependency manager.

For me, it replaces both grunt/gulp and RequireJS.

What does this bundle do?
----

1. Finds javascript entry points inside your twig templates.
2. Runs webpack with [assets-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/sporto/assets-webpack-plugin).
3. Saves generated file names, so that twig function returns correct URL to generated asset.

Additionally, for development environment:

1. Runs [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/), which serves and regenerates assets if they are changed.
2. Watches twig templates for changes, updates entry points and
restarts webpack-dev-server if webpack configuration changes.

More goodies:
1. Lets you configure webpack config as you want, while still providing needed parameters from Symfony, like
entry points, aliases, environment and additional parameters.
2. Lets you define custom entry point providers if you don't use twig or include scripts in any other way.
3. Works with images and css/less/sass files out-of-the-box, if needed.
4. Supports both Webpack 2 (by default) and Webpack 1.

Look at [Symfony, Webpack and AngularJS Single Page Application Demo](https://github.com/mariusbalcytis/symfony-webpack-angular-demo)
for usage examples.

Also look at [MabaWebpackMigrationBundle](https://github.com/mariusbalcytis/webpack-migration-bundle) for 
easier migration from [AsseticBundle](https://github.com/symfony/assetic-bundle) to webpack.

How does this compare to assetic?
----

Webpack lets you create components, which know their own dependencies.

With assetic, you must explicitly provide all needed javascript and stylesheet files in your templates.
If you split one of your javascript files into two files, you need to update all templates where that new dependency
is required. With webpack, you could just `require('./newFile.js');` inside the javascript file and you're done.

Moreover, from javascript your can require CSS files as easily as other javascripts - `require('./styles.css');`
and you're set to go.

If your application is frontend-based, sooner or later you're gonna need to load your assets asynchronously.
This comes by default in webpack. Assetic just bundles the assets, you need to use library like RequireJS
to do that (for example, you can look at [HearsayRequireJSBundle](https://github.com/hearsayit/HearsayRequireJSBundle)
as an alternative).

webpack-dev-server supports hot-reload of your files, sometimes without page refresh
(perfect for styling and some JS frameworks, like React).

Installation
----

```shell
composer require maba/webpack-bundle
```

Inside `AppKernel`:

```php
new Maba\Bundle\WebpackBundle\MabaWebpackBundle(),
```

Run command:

```bash
app/console maba:webpack:setup
```

It copies default `webpack.config.js` and `package.json` files and runs `npm install`.

If any of the files already exists, you'll be asked if you'd like to overwrite them.

`webpack.config.js` must export a function that takes `options` as an argument and returns webpack config.

Feel free to modify this configuration file as you'd like - bundle just provides default one as a starting point.

You should add `webpack.config.js` and `package.json` into your repository. You should also add `node_modules` into
`.gitignore` file and run `npm install` similarly to `composer install` (after cloning repository, after `package.json`
is updated and as a task in your deployment). Of course, you could just add it to your repository, too.

```bash
git add package.json app/config/webpack.config.js
```

If you want to use Webpack 1 for some reason, pass `--useWebpack1` as a command line option to `setup` command.

Usage
----

Inside twig templates:

```twig
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    {% webpack css '@app/bootstrap.less' '@ApplicationBundle/Resources/assets/script.js' %}
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset_url }}"/>
    {% end_webpack %}
</head>
<body>
    
    <img src="{{ webpack_asset('@app/funny-kitten.png') }}"/>
    
    <script src="{{ webpack_asset('@ApplicationBundle/Resources/assets/script.js') }}"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Inside `script.js`:

```js
require('./script2.js');
require('./my-styles.less');

function loadScript3() {
    require.ensure([], function() {
        require('@AnotherBundle/Resources/assets/script3.js');
        require('./style.css');
    });
}
setTimeout(loadScript3, 1000);
```

As part of deployment into production environment, after clearing the cache:

```bash
app/console maba:webpack:compile --env=prod
```

In development environment (this must always run in the background, similar to `assetic:watch`):

```bash
app/console maba:webpack:dev-server
```

Alternatively, if you are not actively developing your frontend, you can compile once and
forget about it, similarly to production environment:

```bash
app/console maba:webpack:compile
```
If you are running functional tests on your app, make sure to compile once for test environment to generate manifest file for test environment:

```bash
app/console maba:webpack:compile --env=test
```

Twig function and tag
----

You can choose between `webpack_asset` function and `webpack` tag.

Function:
```
webpack_asset(resource, type = null)
```

`type` is `js` or `css`, leave `null` to guess the type. For `css` this function could return `null` if no CSS would
be extracted from provided entry point. If you are sure that there will be some CSS, you could just ignore this.
Otherwise, you could use `webpack` tag as it handles this for you (omits the `<link/>` tag entirely in that case).

Tag:
```twig
{% webpack [js|css] [named] [group=...] resource [resource, ...] %}
    Content that will be repeated for each compiled resource.
    {{ asset_url }} - inside this block this variable holds generated URL for current resource
{% end_webpack %}
```

As with `webpack_asset` function, provide `js`, `css` or leave it out to guess the type.

See usage with `named` and `group` in [Using commons chunk](#using-commons-chunk) section.

Keep in mind that you must provide hard-coded asset paths in both tag and function.
This is to find all available assets in compile-time.

Stylesheets
----

By default, [ExtractTextPlugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin) is configured. This means
that if you `require` any file that compiles to CSS (`.css`, `.less`, `.scss`) it is removed from compiled JS file
and stored into a separate one. So you have to include it explicitly.

Keep in mind that when you are providing entry point - it's still usually `.js` file (see usage example).

If you want to disable this functionality so that CSS would be loaded together with JS in a single request,
disable `extract_css`:

```yml
maba_webpack:
    config:
        parameters:
            extract_css: false
```

This plugin is also needed if you want to require css/less/sass files directly as an entry point.

ES6, Less and Sass support
----
ES6, Less and Sass works out of the box:

- use `.js` or `.jsx` extension to compile from ES6 and ES7 to ES5 using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/);
- use `.less` extension to compile [Less](http://lesscss.org/) files;
- use `.scss` extension to compile [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) files.

If you need any custom loaders, feel free to install them via `npm` and modify `app/config/webpack.config.js` if needed.

Loading images
----
Images are optimized by default using [image-webpack-loader](https://github.com/tcoopman/image-webpack-loader).

You can include images directly into your twig templates by using the same `webpack_asset` function.

For this to work correctly, loader for image files must remain `file` in your webpack configuration.

```twig
<img src="{{ webpack_asset('@AcmeHelloBundle/Resources/images/cat.png') }}"/>
```

Of course, you can use them in your CSS, too:

```css
.cat {
    /* cat.png will be optimized and copied to compiled directory with hashed file name */
    /* URL to generated image file will be in the css output  */
    background: url("~@AcmeHelloBundle/Resources/images/cat.png")
}
```

If you are providing webpack-compatible asset path in CSS, prefix it with `~`. Use relative paths as usual.
See [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader) for more information.

Aliases
----

Aliases by default are prefixed with `@` and point to some specific path.
You can change this prefix by configuring `aliases.prefix` parameter.

Aliases work the same in both twig templates (parameter to `webpack_asset` function) and Javascript files
(parameter to `require` or similar Webpack provided function).

By default, these aliases are registered:

- `@app`, which points to `%kernel.root_dir%/Resources/assets`
- `@root`, which points to `%kernel.project_dir%` (usually the root of your repository)
- `@templates`, which points to `%kernel.project_dir%/templates`
- `@assets`, which points to `%kernel.project_dir%/assets`
- `@AcmeHelloBundle` or similar for each of your bundles. This points to root of the bundle (where `Bundle` class is), same as when locating resource in Symfony itself
- `@acme_hello` or similar for each of your bundles. This points to `@AcmeHelloBundle/Resources/assets` by default.

You can also register your own aliases, for example `@bower` or `@npm`
would be great candidates if you use any of those package managers. Or something like `@vendor`
if you use composer to install your frontend assets:

```yml
maba_webpack:
    aliases:
        additional:
            npm: %kernel.root_dir%/node_modules     # or any other path where assets are installed
            bower: %kernel.root_dir%/bower
            vendor: %kernel.root_dir%/../vendor
```

Inside your JavaScript files:

```js
var $ = require('@npm/jquery');
```

In case you want to use different prefix:
```yaml
maba_webpack:
    aliases:
        prefix: '%'
        additional:
            npm: %kernel.root_dir%/node_modules
```
Now inside your JavaScript files:

```js
var $ = require('%npm/jquery');
```


Be sure to install dependencies (either npm, bower or any other) on path not directly accessible from web.
This is not needed by webpack (it compiles them - they can be anywhere on the system) and could cause a security
flaw (some assets contain backend examples, which could be potentially used in your production environment).

Configuration
----

See example with explanations.

```yml
maba_webpack:
    enabled_bundles:
        - ApplicationBundle
    twig:
        additional_directories:
            - %kernel.root_dir%/Resources/partials
        suppress_errors:      true              # whether files not found or twig parse errors should be ignored
                                                # defaults to true in dev environment
                                                # defaults to "ignore_unkwowns" in prod - this option ignores
                                                #     unknown functions etc., but fails on syntax errors
                                                # set to false to always fail on any twig error
    config:
        path:                 '%kernel.root_dir%/config/webpack.config.js'
        parameters:           []        # additional parameters passed to webpack config file
                                        # for example, set dev_server_public_path and public_path to overwrite
                                            # //localhost:8080/compiled/ and /compiled/
                                            # see inside your webpack.config.js for more info
        # set location of cached manifests. Useful for deploy, when you don't want to include your cache directory
        manifest_file_path:        '%kernel.cache_dir%/webpack_manifest.php'
        typescript:           false     # is config file in typescript

    aliases:                            # allows to set aliases inside require() in your JS files
        path_in_bundle:       /Resources/assets     # this means that require('@acme_hello/a.js')
                                                    # will include something like
                                                    # src/Acme/Bundles/AcmeHelloBundle/Resources/assets/a.js
                                                    # see "Aliases" for more information
        prefix:               '@'           # configure default prefix to be added to aliases.
        additional:           []            # provide any other aliases, prefix is always added automatically
    bin:
        webpack:
            executable: # how maba:webpack:compile executes webpack
                        # should be array, for example ['/usr/bin/node', 'node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js']
                - node_modules/.bin/webpack
            arguments:        []        # additional parameters to pass to webpack
                                        # --config with configuration path is always passed
        dev_server:
            executable: # how maba:webpack:dev-server executes webpack-dev-server
                - node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server
            arguments:  # additional parameters to pass to webpack-dev-server; these are default ones
                - --hot
                - --history-api-fallback
                - --inline
        disable_tty: false      # disables TTY setting. Defaults to false in dev environment, true in others.
                                # TTY is needed to run dashboard and/or to display colors, but does not work
                                # in some environments like AWS
        working_directory: %kernel.root_dir%/..
        
    dashboard:                  # configuration for dashboard plugin - only works when TTY available
        enabled: dev_server     # `always` for both compile and dev-server, `false` to disable
        executable:
            - node_modules/.bin/webpack-dashboard
```

## Configuring dev-server

`app/console maba:webpack:dev-server` runs webpack-dev-server as a separate process,
it listens on `localhost:8080`. By default, assets in development
environment are pointed to `//localhost:8080/compiled/*`.

If you run this command inside VM, docker container etc., configure
`maba_webpack.config.parameters.dev_server_public_path` to use correct host. Also, as
dev-server listens only to localhost connections by default, add this to configuration:

```yml
maba_webpack:
    bin:
        dev_server:
            arguments:
                - --hot                     # these are default options - leave them if needed
                - --history-api-fallback
                - --inline
                - --host                    # let's add host option
                - 0.0.0.0                   # each line is escaped, so option comes in it's own line
                - --public                  # this is also needed from webpack-dev-server 2.4.3
                - dev-server-host.dev:8080  # change to whatever host you are using
    config:
        parameters:                         # this is where the assets will be loaded from
            dev_server_public_path: //dev-server-host.dev:8080/compiled/
            dev_server: {}                  # any additional parameters to pass to `devServer` configuration
```

If you need to provide different port, be sure to put `--port` and the port itself into separate lines.

When compiling assets with `webpack-dev-server`, [webpack-dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard)
is used for more user-friendly experience. You can disable it by setting `tty_prefix` option to `[]`.
You can also remove `DashboardPlugin` in such case from `webpack.config.js`.

## Configuring memory for Node.js

If you are experiencing "heap out of memory" error when running `maba:webpack:compile`
and/or `maba:webpack:dev-server`, try to give more memory for Node.js process:

```yml
maba_webpack:
    bin:
        webpack:        # same with dev_server
            executable:
                - node
                - "--max-old-space-size=4096"   # 4GB
                - node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js
```

## Configuration for config in Typescript

If you want to write your
[webpack config in Typescript](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-languages/#typescript), you need to 
set `maba_webpack.config.typescript` to true. If you want to use a specific `tsconfig.json` file for `ts-node` to run, 
set the path before webpack binary:

```yml
maba_webpack:
    bin:
        webpack:
            executable:
                - 'TS_NODE_PROJECT="%kernel.root_dir%/config/tsconfig.json"'
                - 'node_modules/.bin/webpack'
        dev-server:
            executable:
                - 'TS_NODE_PROJECT="%kernel.root_dir%/config/tsconfig.json"'
                - 'node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server'
```

Using commons chunk
----

This bundle supports both single and several
[commons chunks](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/commons-chunk-plugin/),
but you have to configure this explicitly.

In your `webpack.config.js`:

```js
config.plugins.push(
    new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
        name: 'commons'
    })
);
```

In your base template:

```twig
{% webpack named css 'commons' %}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset_url }}"/>
{% end_webpack %}
{# ... #}
{% webpack named js 'commons' %}
    <script src="{{ asset_url }}"></script>
{% end_webpack %}
```

You can also use `webpack_named_asset` twig function instead of `webpack` tags.


### Grouped commons chunks

`webpack` tag supports `group` option:

```twig
{% webpack js '@app/admin-init.js' group='admin' %}
    <script src="{{ asset_url }}"></script>
{% end_webpack %}
```

Name of assets are given in `options.groups`, which is passed to your `webpack.config.js`.
Assets without group set are assigned to `default` group. Configuration example:

```js
config.plugins.push(new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
    name: 'admin_commons_chunk',
    chunks: options.groups['admin']
}));
config.plugins.push(new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
    name: 'front_commons_chunk',
    chunks: options.groups['default']
}));
```

Keep in mind that currently the same entry point cannot belong to several groups,
even if it's used in different places. This means that you must provide the same
group for JavaScript and CSS versions of the same asset.

### Note on bundle inheritance

If you use bundles with inheritance, keep in mind, that the assets themselves are usually
resolved in different context (in webpack itself), assets pointing to parent bundle (by it's aliases)
will actually point to child bundle. This allows you to override any of the assets in the parent bundle,
but requires to copy all of them, as they will not be looked in parent bundle's directory at all.

Semantic versioning
----

This bundle follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Public API of this bundle (in other words, you should only use these features if you want to easily update
to new versions):
- only services that are not marked as `public="false"`
- only classes, interfaces and class methods that are marked with `@api`
- twig functions and tags
- console commands
- supported DIC tags

For example, if only class method is marked with `@api`, you should not extend that class, as constructor
could change in any release.

See [Symfony BC rules](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/bc.html) for basic information
about what can be changed and what not in the API. Keep in mind, that in this bundle everything is
`@internal` by default.

After updating this bundle, you should re-run `maba:webpack:setup` command and review changes in files,
merge them with any of your own. This bundle **might** make an assumption that all the needed dependencies
are installed. As compiling is made beforehand as a deployment step, you should notice any errors in
your staging environment if there would be any.

Alternatives?
----

There are a few alternatives out there for integrating webpack.

### Plain simple webpack commands

I would really recommend this approach - just split your frontend code (HTML, CSS, JS) from
backend code (PHP + some HTTP API).

Especially if you have single-page application, there is really not much point in integrating your webpack
workflow with Symfony.

In this case you could use [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin) to generate HTML with correct URL to your bundled javascript file.

### [ju1ius/WebpackAssetsBundle](https://github.com/ju1ius/WebpackAssetsBundle)

This is minimal bundle to provide compiled file names into your twig templates.
It also uses [assets-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/sporto/assets-webpack-plugin).

What it's missing when compared to this bundle - gathering all entry points. You must manually set them inside your webpack config.
If there are only few of them, this is usually not that hard to maintain.

Webpack config is completely manual and does not integrate with your Symfony application.

### [hostnet/webpack-bundle](https://github.com/hostnet/webpack-bundle)

This bundle gathers all entry points, but does not provide generated URLs to use inside your twig templates.
It does solve this problem by appending modification timestamp for cache busting.

Webpack config is completely integrated into your Symfony application and requires custom PHP code for
any custom configuration changes.

In development environment, it generates assets on request. This can be more convenient than having
to run specific command in the background, but is usually slower. Also at this point it's kind of hard
to integrate it with webpack-dev-server.

It has more tags for twig, like inline scripts. One example is inline splitpoint
generation which allows you to generate simple splitpoints per file.
